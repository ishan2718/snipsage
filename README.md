About The Project
SnipSage is a multi-tool for developers, offering a suite of commands to accelerate your workflow. It can explain complex code in plain English, generate complete unit tests, add helpful inline comments, refactor code for better performance and readability, and even generate professional docstrings. Itâ€™s a seamless assistant that feels like a native part of the development workflow, inspired by the universal challenge of deciphering complex and unfamiliar code.
